# Cancer Center Referral Model

 # Introduction
 Welcome to the Cancer Center Referral Model project repository! This project aims to develop a model to address the growing number of referrals at the Anderson Cancer Center. The initial step involves identifying essential variables for securing donor funding, which will be achieved through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the cancer dataset.

# Project Overview
 As a Data Analyst at the Anderson Cancer Center, the task is to develop a model to manage the increasing number of referrals efficiently. To address this, Principal 
 Component Analysis (PCA) has been chosen as the most suitable technique to identify essential variables for securing donor funding. The cancer dataset available from 
 sklearn.datasets will be utilized for this purpose.

# Installation
To get started with the project, you need to follow these steps:

 * Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/PAUL-byte-spec/Anderson-CC---PCA.git
 * Navigate to the project directory: cd cancer-center-referral-model
 * Install the required Python packages

# Usage
Once the repository is cloned and the dependencies are installed, you can proceed with running the PCA implementation script. Follow these steps:

 * Run the PCA implementation script: Advanced Cancer Center PCA.ipynb
 * The script will perform PCA on the cancer dataset, reduce it into 2 PCA components, and display the results.

# NOTE
After running the PCA implementation script, you will observe the following results:

  * The first few rows of the DataFrame containing the PCA components and the target variable.
  * A scatter plot visualizing the distribution of classes (malignant and benign tumors) in the reduced dimensional space defined by the first two principal components.
